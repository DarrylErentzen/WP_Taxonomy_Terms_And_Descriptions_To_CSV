WP_Taxonomy_Terms_And_Descriptions_To_CSV
==================

Exports top 2 levels of Terms for ALL WordPress Hierarchical Taxonomies to a .CSV file.

Quick kludge for a common task that for some inexplicable reason seems to have no Plugin designed for it.

COMING SOON:
- plugin to do this right
- much undeserved fanfare
